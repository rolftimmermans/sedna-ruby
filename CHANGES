=== 0.5.2

* Released on May 29th, 2010.
* Bundled Sedna driver from version 3.3.55 (protocol version 3.0). The bundled
  driver is now used by default to simplify installation.
* Fixed build errors on Mac OS X 10.6.
* Unit test compatibility with version 3.3.

=== 0.5.0

* Released on April 26th, 2009.

=== 0.4.0

* Released on January 4th, 2009.
* Added Sedna#reset, which closes the current connection and reconnects.
* Added Sedna#connected?, which returns whether or not the current connection
  is still active.
* Sedna#transaction can now also be used without a block. Use the newly added
  methods Sedna#commit and Sedna#rollback to finish such a declarative
  transaction. Note that this style is not recommended if a transaction can
  be wrapped in a block.
* Sedna.connect no longer blocks other threads in Ruby 1.9.1+. Use Sedna.blocking?
  to discover if support for non-blocking behaviour is enabled.
* Strings in the result Array of Sedna#execute are now in UTF-8 encoding in
  Ruby 1.9, rather than binary.
* Fully tested in Ruby 1.8.5+ (including the latest version, 1.9.1 RC1).
* Now also compiles with Ruby 1.9.0.x, but non-blocking behaviour is disabled
  for these versions.
