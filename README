= \Sedna XML database client library

This library provides a Ruby client for <i>Sedna</i>, an open-source, native XML
database system. The client is a Ruby extension that uses the official C
driver that is shipped as part of the S<i></i>edna distribution.

\Sedna provides a full range of core database services -- persistent storage,
ACID transactions, security, indices, hot backup. Flexible XML processing
facilities include W3C XQuery implementation, tight integration of XQuery with
full-text search facilities and a node-level update language.

For more information about the \Sedna XML database system, see the project page

=== Current version

The current version of this library is 0.1.0. This version is a <b>development
preview</b>. The API may change significantly between minor versions.
For a complete overview all recent and previous changes, see CHANGES.

=== Requirements

Before installing the \Sedna client library, make sure you have the library and
header files of the C driver. They are shipped and installed as part of the binary
distribution of \Sedna. When installing, choose either <tt>/usr/local/sedna</tt> or
<tt>/opt/sedna</tt> as target locations.

=== Installation

After installing the \Sedna C driver (see above), simply install the Ruby client
library as a rubygem.

  % gem install sedna

If the library or header files of the S<i></i>edna C driver are located at non-default
locations, you can specify these locations by adding the <tt>--with-sedna-lib</tt>
or <tt>--with-sedna-include</tt> options when installing.

  % gem install sedna -- --with-sedna-lib=/path/to/sedna/lib --with-sedna-include=/path/to/sedna/include

=== Usage

After installation of the gem, +require+ the sedna library in order to start
using it.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'sedna'

To start querying a database, create a new connection with the Sedna.connect
method. When a block is given, the Sedna connection object will be returned
which can be used to execute database statements.

  connection_details = {
    :database => "my_db",
    :host => "localhost",
    :username => "SYSTEM",
    :password => "MANAGER",
  }
  Sedna.connect(connection_details) do |sedna|
    # Start querying the database.
    sedna.execute("create document 'mydoc'")                                  #=> nil
    sedna.execute("update insert <msg>Hello world!</msg> into doc('mydoc')")  #=> nil
    sedna.execute("doc('mydoc')/msg/text()")                                  #=> ["Hello world!"]
    # The connection is closed automatically for us.
  end

See the documentation of the Sedna class -- the methods Sedna.connect and
Sedna#execute in particular -- for more details.
